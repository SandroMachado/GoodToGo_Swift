Good To Go Swift
-----

The intent of this project is to have a place where I can have all my [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) apps connected, and separated and the same time. Also a place where I can easily try new things without loosing to much time preparing a new project, making class's or extensions I could neeed for a fast project/demo.
